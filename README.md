# Differential Equations
A set of python scripts handling the solutions of differential equations

## 1D_Wave_Equation
Solution to the wave equation in 1 dimention, provides animation of how wave progresses over time 

## 2D_Wave_Animation
Solution to the wave equation providing supplied initial conditions and produces a plot of how this wave evolves over time
## fourier (deffo rename this)
Produces animation showing fourier transform and how it tends toward original function for increaing  n


-----
### to do 

slow down convergence to function
add method to calculate fourier coefficients algebraically

## Heat_Equation_Coloured 

## phasePlane 

plots a phase equation for the given system of differential equations
